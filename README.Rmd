The goal of libminer is to provide an overview of your R library setup. It is a toy
package created as a part of a workshop and not meant for serious use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of libminer from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ateucher/libminer")
```

## Example usage

To get a count of installed packages in each of your library locations, 
optionally with the total sizes, use the `lib_summary()` function:

```{r example}
library(libminer)
lib_summary()
# specify `sizes = TRUE` to calculate the total size on disk of your packages
lib_summary(sizes = TRUE)
```
